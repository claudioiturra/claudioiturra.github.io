Internship Title: Observations of near-inertial current variability over the continental Shelf of Concepcion, Chile.

ODU Advisor : Dr. John M. Klinck

The purpose of the internship at CCPO, ODU is to describe near-inertial current in the shallow shelf of Concepcion, Chile. Data analysis of the continental shelf currents (summer, fall, winter), temperature (thermistor chain), sea level pressure, hydrography, and remote sensors together with the application of a semi-analytical model, will be used to estimate the importance of remote wind forcing on the near-inertial current variability in the shelf of Concepcion. Numerical and analytical models models provide estimates of the near-inertial energy transfer into the mixed layer and the fraction radiated into the interior. An example of an analytical method is the slab model, capable of representing the wind-driven near-inertial currents in the mixed layer for several inertial cycles. Inertial current simulated will be correlated with in-situ current data from the shelf of Concepcion, and with specific wind patterns associated with the daily cycle of the wind (sea breeze), storms, and the resonance of different signals of the wind close to the local inertial period. In addition, temperature measurements of the water column will be correlate with near-inertial current variability.

Near-inertial currents contribute high energy to the dynamics of the shallow ocean, especially in an area of high biological productivity due to the seasonal upwelling and high mesoscale activity. The consequences of inertial current in the coastal ocean could affect residence times and mixing, affecting pollutions transport, plankton distribution, and nutrient supply to the euphotic zone. Therefore, high-frequency variability process related to near-inertial current can be an important key factor to understand complex coastal research questions of the central south of Chile; such’s as favorable environmental conditions for Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB), and the diurnal variability in the concentration of emerging contaminants in the shallow coastal ocean.  

Internship specific objective : Estimate with numerical and analytical models the importance of remote wind forcing on the near-inertial current variability in the shelf of Concepcion.

Study Area : The South-central coast of Chile around the city of Concepcion is an important coastal upwelling zone and represent our study region (Fig.1).

##### Data available

The oceanographic data include coastal wind observations (10 years hourly weather stations, and reanalysis data), ocean current, hydrography, temperature moorings, and a daily composity of level 2 sea surface temperature and chlorophyll. The ocean current time series were registered at the location L1 in three periods, which span the months of January (summer), July and August (winter) of the year 2005, and the months of March to May of the year 2006 (Fall). Additionally, ocean current were measured at the location L2 during the months of August and September (winter) of the year 2006.

Figure 02: The Sub-Inertial circulation, the Sea Surface Temperature, and the wind stress during the season of summer and winter of 2005 and fall of 2006 are represented in the panels a-b-c and d (the mean sea surface wind fields was calculated for the four observational periods). The panel a) represent the SST  average (Level 2 Composite) during December 26 of 2004 to January 28 of 2005, same time length is represented for the sub-inertial current in the progressive vector diagram at the location L1. The vertical average of the sub-inertial current represented in the light grey rectangle, have also the same time length of the previous product represented. The panel b) and d) represent the same analysis of the panel a), but for the season of winter and fall. The panel c) represent the sub-inertial circulation at the locations L1 and L2 during the same period of time, during August 12 to September 5 of the year 2005. The vertical average of the sub-inertial circulation represented in the light grey rectangle, shows in blue the current profile in the location L2, and in red the location L1.
